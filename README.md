# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Model
This repository contains an implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for answering questions based on a corpus of documents. It leverages a pre-trained RAG model from Facebook AI (facebook/rag-token-nq) for document retrieval and text generation, and answer extraction from retrieved documents.
